# MTA Traffic Analysis for Stations in Manhattan

## Abstract
The goal of this project was to use exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find the top stations around Manhattan in terms of daily traffic to choose where to send promoters of the Children's Scholarship Fund to in order to promote the not for profit organization which is based in New York City.

## Data
The Metropolitan Transport Authority (MTA) turnstiles dataset that was used for this project contains all the stations of New York City with cumulative entries and exits of each turnstile in each station. These enties and exits are counted in intervals during each day. Certain columns of the dataset can be grouped together to get daily entries and exits per station.

## Algorithms

*Entry & Exit Counts*

Converting cumulative entries and exits to counts by subtracting from previous entries and exits.

*Total Traffic*

Summing entry and exit counts to get total traffic

*Day of the Week*

Getting day of the week from each date and specifying if its a weekday or weekend
